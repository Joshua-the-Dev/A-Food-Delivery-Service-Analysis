# FOOD ORDERS IN NEW DELHI - OVERVIEW
This report analyzes the operational and financial performance of a food delivery service that is currently facing challenges in achieving profitability. Using a dataset of 1,000 food orders, the project aims to explore the key drivers of cost and revenue, evaluate the existing cost structure, and uncover insights into individual & overall profitability. The goal is to identify strategic opportunities for improving efficiency and profitability across the service's operations.
# OBJECTIVES OF THE ANALYSIS
The task was to conduct:
- Detailed Cost Analysis: Identify the major cost components associated with delivering food orders, including direct costs like delivery fees and indirect costs like discounts and payment processing fees.
- Profitability Evaluation: Calculate the profitability of individual orders and aggregate this data to assess overall profitability. This involves examining how revenue generated from commission fees measures against the total costs.
- Strategic Recommendations for Improvement: Based on the cost and profitability analysis, identify actionable strategies to reduce costs, adjust pricing, commission fees, and discount strategies to improve profitability. This includes finding a “sweet spot” for commission and discount percentages that ensures profitability across orders.
- Impact Simulation of Proposed Strategies: Simulate the financial impact of the recommended strategies on profitability, using the dataset to forecast how adjustments in commission rates and discount strategies could potentially transform current losses into profits.
